# AndroidStudioProjects
This project is part of Udacity's 'Android Basics: User Input' course.

Just Java is an app that takes a simple order for coffee(s) and allows the user to email it with an external emailing app. Because the app is for practice only, the order form is not a real reciept and does not have a designated recipient.
